#' Kabsch Algorithm in R code
#'
#' Aligns two sets of points via rotation and translation after
#'   solving the superpositioning problem in an Eigenvalue Ansatz.
#'
#' Given two sets of points, with one specified as the reference set,
#' the other set will be rotated so that the RMSD between the two is minimized.
#' The format of the matrix is that there should be one row for each of
#' n observations, and the number of columns, d, specifies the dimensionality
#' of the points. The point sets must be of equal size and with the same
#' ordering, i.e. point one of the second matrix is mapped to point one of
#' the reference matrix, point two of the second matrix is mapped to point two
#' of the reference matrix, and so on.
#'
#' @param P n x d matrix of reference points.
#' @param Q n x d matrix of points to align to to \code{pm}
#' @return Matrix \code{qm} rotated and translated so that the ith point
#'	is aligned to the ith point of \code{pm} in the least-squares sense.
